# java-password-manager
A password manager written in java for learning purposes only

## IN DEVELOPMENT

There are no final comments on the code, every line of comment
are meant to be deleted, turned to code, and some code needs to
be refactored still.

## Idea

Building a simple java application that registers a passphrase
from the user, which will be used to get access to all passwords.

These passwords will be encrypted and stored.

The passphrase will only be stored as a salted hash.

Before every intent to run the application, all application files must
be checked, otherwise it won't be able to do what it is supposed to do
